											<h2>Hello</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											My name is Gunnar Magnussen and I am currently studying towards my MSc in Games on the technology track at ITU, which I will finish in the summer of 2025.
										</p>
										<p>
											My main programming languages are C++ and C# and my areas of expertice are player movement and graphics.  I have a lot of experience with Unity, but am also familiar with other engines, such as Unreal.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am a creative person with a technical skillset and a  passion for making games. I've been making games almost as long as I have been playing them. I'm a quick learner and try to always stay in the beginner's mindset to never miss opportunities to learn something new.
										</p>

												<h3>Game Jams</h3>
											</header>
											<img width="200px" src="images/gamejams.jpg"/>
											<p>
												I participated in my first game jam in 2013 and have been jamming ever since. I love the creative energy and the pressure of the 48 hour deadline. I have participated in jams for teams, such as Global Game Jam, Nordic Game Jam and FÃ¸roya Tele Game Jam, and jams for individuals, such as Ludum Dare and One Hour Game Jam.
											</p>

												<h3>Judo</h3>
											</header>
											<img width="200px" src="images/judo.jpg"/>
											<p>
												I keep myself physically active with the Japanese grappling martial art and sport, judo. I've practiced judo for many years now and have often helped with various tasks and events. I have been Faroese national champion and have also coached a lot. In 2022 I worked for Amager Judo Skole on what was, at the time, the biggest project to introduce judo to schools in Denmark, introducing 46 school classes in Copenhagen to judo.
											</p>

												<h3>Cosplay</h3>
											</header>
											<img width="200px" src="images/cloudCosplay.jpg"/>
											<p>
												Cosplay is a hobby that, similar to making games, allows me to be creative and use a lot of different skills to bring an idea to life. I enjoy and the community aspect, engrossing myself in a character, and the craftsmanship involved in making my own cosplays. In February 2023 I entered my first cosplay craftsmanship competition and won 2nd place. In 2024 I won the <i>Best Look-Alike</i> award at J-Popcon, the largest cosplay craftsmanship competition in Denmark.
